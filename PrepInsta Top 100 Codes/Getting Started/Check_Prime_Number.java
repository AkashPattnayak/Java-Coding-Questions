/*
 * Write a program in java to check if a given number is prime or not
 * DefinitionðŸš€ :
 * 
 * A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.
 *  
 * A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because 
 * the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 Ã— 5 or 5 Ã— 1, involve 5 itself
 * 
 * Sample input1: 2
 * Sample output1: 2 is a prime number
 * 
 * Sample input2: 4
 * Sample output2: 4 is not a prime number

     * Basically here i are those numbers starting from 2 to (original number/2)-1,
     * for example:
     *     If we enter 10 then i will be 2 to 9
     * And in each iteration we will check which numbers(i) are completely dividing the original numbers.
     * We are doing so because we need factors.
     * 
     * 
     * The logic of the below code is very simple
     * 
     * As we know Numbers having only two factors i.e. 1 and the number itself are called prime numbers. 
     * 
     * So here we start i(numbers which will divide to original number in each iteration) from 2 and increasing i value till i value is (number/2)-1
     * that means we have not divide the number by 1 and number itself as it will always true so by default the original number has two factors i.e 1 and number itself.
     * 
     * So now if any value of i will divide the original number then flag value will be false and loop will be break. The reason is now the factors of number
     * has increased from 2 to 3 which clearly indicate the given number is not a prime number.
