/*
 * This program demonstrates the sum of numbers between a given range. 
 * The user is prompted to enter the starting number and ending number.
 * The program will then calculate the sum of all numbers between the starting and ending number.
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * Sample Input:
 *    Enter the starting number: 1
 *    Enter the ending number: 10
 * sample Output:
 *    Sum of the numbers between 1 and 10 is: 55
 * Explanation:
 * 
 * The sum of the numbers between 1 and 10 is equal to the sum of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.
 * i.e  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55
